Linked List

    - Linear data structure
    - Elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations
    - Elements are stored in nodes
    - Every node has two parts: data and pointer to next node
    - All the nodes are connected to each other using pointers as a chain (linked list)
    - Linked list is a chain of nodes connected to each other using pointers
