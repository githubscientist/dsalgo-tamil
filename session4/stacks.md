Stack Data Structure

    - A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO).
    - A stack has the following main operations:
        - push: adds an element to the stack
        - pop: removes an element from the stack
        - peek: get the topmost element of the stack
        - isEmpty: check if the stack is empty
    - Stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
